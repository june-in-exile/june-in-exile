Hi, I’m June, a software engineer passionate about blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, and cryptographic systems. I have Web2 experience developing in Golang at a small exchange, as well as full-stack blockchain experience. Recently, I built a [ZK-based digital will system](https://github.com/june-in-exile/zkWill) compatible with Taiwan’s sealed will framework. I also designed [AES-256-GCM](https://github.com/june-in-exile/aes256-gcm-circom) and [Keccak256](https://github.com/june-in-exile/keccak256-circom) circuits with record-low constraint sizes. Happy to discuss anything related to blockchain and ZK.
